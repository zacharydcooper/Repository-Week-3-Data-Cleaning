Repository-Week-3-Data-Cleaning
===============================
Readme.

For this assignment the first thing that I did was merge the data files together and structure them to have values that act as a "key" or identifier.  I combined the test and training data and meshed their columns.  From there I completed the requirement of adding only measurements for mean and standard deviation using mean\\ and std\\. Once the data was prepped I added more descriptive names, although not insanely descriptive the formatting was fixed so they don't look like they are fresh out of a database.  The last step was tidying up the data which consisted of simple arrangements and name structure.  Once the data was accurately aggregated and merged I submitted it as a text file as per the requirements.  I gave that dirty old data bath.
