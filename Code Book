The best code book in history?
Possibly.

Source Data
A full description of the data used in this project can be found at [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

Data Set Information
This expirement was done on volunteers age range 19-48 years. 
The participants performed physical activities wearing a Galaxy phone on their waist (I got an HTC One instead of a Galaxy, I kind of regret it).  The phones sensors monitored their activity.

Attribute Information
For each record in the dataset it is provided: 
Triaxial acceleration
Triaxial Angular 
561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
activity label. 
identifier of the participant.

Merged the tables together.
features.txt
activity_labels.txt
subject_train.txt
x_train.txt
y_train.txt
subject_test.txt
x_test.txt
y_test.txt
Assign column names and merge to create one data set.


Extracted only relevant Means and Std Deviations, as well as an identifier.
Changed names of data to be more useful.

SUBJECT - each individual subject for the test.
ACTIVITY/ACTIVITY ID - What activity were they partaking in.
ID - Mean for activity for person
the rest - a bunch of boring confusing metrics for the activities changed into Means and standard deviations to calculate what each activity registered on their Galaxy.
